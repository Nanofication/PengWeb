<section class="founder-story container my-5 p-4 rounded" style="background-color: #f1f1f1;">
  <h2 class="section-title">Our Founder’s Passion</h2>
  <p>
    Mr Li, the founder of our company, has a deep passion for rescuing and caring for stray animals.
    He firmly believes that the most despicable individuals are those who adopt pets out of fleeting affection,
    only to abandon them when their interest fades. Over the years, he has provided a home to countless stray animals,
    driven by his unwavering compassion.
  </p>
  <p>
    During his frequent trips to purchase pet supplies, he connected with many like-minded individuals
    who shared his love for animals. These interactions not only strengthened his dedication but also
    helped him gain extensive knowledge about pet products. Over time, he became an expert in the field.
  </p>
  <p>
    Inspired by his experiences and fueled by his desire to make a difference, he decided to establish his own pet company.
    His mission is to offer high-quality, reliable pet products at affordable prices for fellow pet lovers.
    By doing so, he not only supports the needs of pet owners but also generates the resources necessary to continue
    rescuing and caring for stray animals.
  </p>
  <p>
    This venture allows him to combine his passion with purpose—making a living while making a lasting
    impact on the lives of countless animals in need.
